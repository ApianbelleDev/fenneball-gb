# Fenneball-GB
fenneball-gb is a gb port of a desktop app I developed in raylib called Fenneball. it's written in sm83 assembly. that's right! no shortcuts here :3
<br>
# dependencies
rgbds 0.6.1<br>
GNU make<br>

# build instructions
make sure GNU make and [RGBDS](https://rgbds.gbdev.io) are installed, then type `make`. the resulting rom will be built in `bin/` and you can run that in whatever emulator you like (I recommend Mesen2. it's what my partner uses, and it's accuracy and debugging tools are extremely good :3)


# credits
here are some really cool people who helped out on this project.<br>
[sylvie](https://zlago.github.io) - my partner. extremely helpful and knowledgeable with the gameboy, and assembly in general.<br>

the ENTIRE gbdev community - extremely helpful, and nice. while they didn't help with anything specifically with this project, ~~not yet anyway~~ they're still an extremely cool group of people and very helpful. figured I'd go ahead and mention them anyway :3


that's all for now ;3
